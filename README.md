# Corrupted File

## Solution

The only components of the QR code that matters are the three squares. So what you can do is open the photo in an image editor, copy the untouched square (in the top right) and copy and paste over the 2 overdrawn squares. The qr should be scannable

Note there is a hidden image zipped in but it is a red herring and leads to a rickroll ;)
