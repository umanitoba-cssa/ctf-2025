# Literally Empty Evidence

## Description

I got nothing but I swear this has something 

(Note this does not have the cssactf{} included but the decoded message should be there)

## Hint

Perhaps this is a special type of nothing. And why is not just one line? 

## Solution

The flag is encoded in Morse Code where each tab (\t) is a -, new line (\n) is . and \* \* is the same. Simply create a program that converts into morse code and run an online compiler to reveal the flag

## Flag

`cssactf{NowYouSeeMeNowYouDont}`
