**Personal Notes - Case JA41**
- Something odd about the petechial hemmorrhaging. Could indicate strangulation, but not clear ligature marks...?
- Unidentified compound from toxicology - need lab to expedite results.
- Positioning of the body is inconsistent with a simple fall. If he was standing, why no defensive injuries?
- Need to check medical history - any chance of an aneurysm?

PD sent me an email late last Friday saying they uploaded a new witness statement, but I think they accidentally
set the wrong permissions level on the file so I can't access it. Those cops are such idiots I swear.
