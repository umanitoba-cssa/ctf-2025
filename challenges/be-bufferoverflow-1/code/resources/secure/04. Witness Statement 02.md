**Statement:**
"I'll be real with you, I was pretty hammered on my way back home, don't recall much. Actually you know what though, there was one thing that stood out, probably a block or two down the road there was this massive truck parked on the street! Never seen it in our neighbourhood before, it was one of those, shoot what are they called, you know those big stupid pointy lookin hunks of steel they tryna pass off as being a truck. Space car... Cyber car... Cyber Truck! Yeah one of those things! Honestly just stood there laughing at the damn thing it looked so stupid. Had a weird vanity plate number too, one word I think but I'll be damned if I could remember exactly what it said. I went to check for it the next morning to ask the neighbors how much of their life savings they wasted on that pile of garbage, but it was gone! Haven't seen it since."
