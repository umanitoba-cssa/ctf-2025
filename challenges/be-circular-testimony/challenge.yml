description: "Idea provided by Rob Guderian (thanks Rob).\n\nDetective Miles has been\
  \ investigating the notorious \"Circular Killer\" for months. The murderer is known\
  \ for arranging victims in a circular pattern and leaving cryptic messages written\
  \ in code at each crime scene.\n\nAfter interviewing a key witness who glimpsed\
  \ the killer's latest message, Detective Miles recorded the testimony in his custom\
  \ digital recorder\u2014a device he designed himself. But when reviewing the notes\
  \ later, something strange happened: only fragments of the witness's account were\
  \ visible, and what might be crucial evidence seems to have disappeared.\n\nMiles\
  \ needs your help to recover the complete testimony, which might contain information\
  \ about the killer's identity or their next target. Can you exploit the device's\
  \ memory bug and reveal the hidden message before the killer strikes again?"
