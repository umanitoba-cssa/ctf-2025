**Date:** [REDACTED]

**Statement:**
"I heard a loud noise around 11:30PM, like something heavy hitting the floor. Didn't think much of it - figured it was just Jonathan dropping something. We weren't close, but I know he kept odd hours. The next morning, I saw his front door was ajar. That's when I called the police."

**Additional notes:** Witness claims no unusual visitors earlier that evening.
