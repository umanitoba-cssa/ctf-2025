## Description
That witness testimony about the truck was a good find! Well, maybe. More like it's the only thing resembling a lead that we have, so might as well follow it.

There's only one Tesla dealership in town, so we asked to take a look at their transaction database. They agreed to let us see a list of purchases, but it just has dates and subtotals. They won't let us see any of the transaction details without a warrant.

Well, getting a warrant is far too much paperwork for my tastes. Maybe you can find a hole in the system to get us the full transaction details?

## Hints
1. The code seems similar to the last challenge, what happens when you try the same exploit again?
4. This might be a helpful resource: <https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/stack-canaries/>

## Solution
Same idea as the previous challenge, but now stack canaries are enabled. Only 32bit so brute-forceable, you'll need to write a script for this one!
