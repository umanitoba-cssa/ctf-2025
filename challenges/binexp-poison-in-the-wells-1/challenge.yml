description: "Hey kid! I think I may be in need of a hacker! The family of the deceased Jonathan Wells say they've gotten a hunch that the cops on this case might not be giving it their all, so they asked me to conduct a private investigation on the side while the police do their work. Not sure what tipped them off, could be all in their heads, who knows! But money is money.\n\nThe only problem, well, it's the digital age! And grandpa here doesn't know jack about computers. And it looks like there's some funny business going on with some computers. So I'm calling on you to help me out! Here's the sich.\n\nThe coroner on this case gave us access to the relevant documents on their file server. They told me that one of the witness statements has a password applied to it, but the PD says they never set one. And apparently, they don't have a backup. Sounds fishy if you ask me. Think you could find a way to get access to that document? \n\nThis server software is ancient and the company that wrote\
  \ it filed for bankruptcy decades ago over lawsuits related to security flaws in their software before they got bought out by some megacorp... which of course means the PD hasn't bothered to upgrade to anything better. Perhaps you can find one of those flaws? I found a demo copy of the client software and it's source code on the Internet Archive, so take a look.\n\nConnect with SSH:\n- Enter this command in your terminal: `ssh detective@poison-in-the-wells-1.ctf.umanitobacssa.ca -p 30201`\n- Enter this password when prompted: `ctf2025!`\n\n*A copy of the server software and source code is provided for your reference. The binary is identical to the hosted version, however the flag can only be found in the hosted version of the program.*\n\nHints:\n1. The file is protected by a password, maybe there's some way to pass that check without knowing the real password?\n2.
