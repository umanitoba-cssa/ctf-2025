description: 'Hm, a corporate entity buying a CyberTruck? Why? And no lease term? That''s quite suspicious indeed!


  I went to the agency that handled the insurance registration for the car. Well, they were less than helpful to be honest. I squeezed out of them that Isaac was the employee that handled the sign-up but they wouldn''t give us access to any records. So... I "social engineered" this Isaac to get his employee login to the broker''s database! That''s what the kids call it, right?


  I can see that Luxewood is listed under Isaac''s account, so that info was right at least. But we need to figure out who is tied to that business registration, and all the contact information for the business registrations are locked behind a password. Can you see if there''s some way we can get access to that document?


  Connect with SSH:

  - Enter this command in your terminal: `ssh isaac@poison-in-the-wells-3.ctf.umanitobacssa.ca -p 30203`

  - Enter this password when prompted: `ctf2025!`

  Hints:

  1. Is the password for the business contact information being stored somewhere vulnerable?

  2. We know how to use a buffer overflow to write data to the stack, but what can we do to read data from the stack?
