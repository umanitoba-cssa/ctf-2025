description: "You're good kid! So we've got a name to work with now, but we don't\
  \ actually have any *proof* that Mr. Cain is connected to this case yet.\n\nSo how\
  \ do we link Mr. Cain to the crime? Well, I heard from the cops that he *was* a\
  \ suspect in the case, but Mr. Cain had an alibi - his Google maps timeline showed\
  \ he was at a pub on the other end of the city at the time of the murder. Look kid,\
  \ I've worked in this industry long enough to know that GPS data ain't worth nothin'\
  \ if you don't know who actually had posession of the tracking device. And Mr. Cain\
  \ claims he was drinking alone, so there's no one else who can confirm he was really\
  \ at that location. Not a very strong alibi if you ask me!\n\nLet's review what\
  \ we know: First, the cause of Mr. Wells' death is unknown, but we do know that\
  \ someone with a high level permission on the file server was tampering with the\
  \ case documents. Second, a Cybertruck was spotted near the scene of the crime,\
  \ and we know Mr. Cain owns one. Third, Mr. Cain claims he was out for drinks, but\
  \ he has no one who can confirm it.\n\nAll this is pointing to one thing: money.\
  \ What if we could knock out three birds with one stone: figure out who he might\
  \ work for that could give him access to the document server, figure out if he really\
  \ bought that Cybertruck for himself, and figure out if he really was out buying\
  \ drinks at the pub? \n\nI say we take a look at his bank account. I happen to have\
  \ an account at the very same branch of Mr. Cain! Not sure if this will be of any\
  \ help, but feel free to poke around my account. My username is `dgumshoe` and my\
  \ password is `w1z@rdk1d`.\n\nThis could be it kid! You've done well so far, if\
  \ you can also find a way to break into the transaction database of a literal bank,\
  \ we might crack this case!\n\nConnect with SSH:\n- Enter this command in your terminal:\
  \ `ssh gateway@poison-in-the-wells-4.ctf.umanitobacssa.ca -p 30204`\n- Enter this\
  \ password when prompted: `ctf2025!`\n\n*A copy of the server software and source\
  \ code is provided for your reference. The binary is identical to the hosted version,\
  \ however the flag can only be found in the hosted version of the program.*\n\n\
  Hints:\n1. You'll need to use everything you've learned so far. No help for this\
  \ one!"
