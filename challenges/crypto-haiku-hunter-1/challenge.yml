  \ the \"Haiku Hunter\" has struck! A victim was found with a strange encrypted note\
  \ pinned to their chest. The only clue to decode it might be in this haiku left\
  \ at the scene:\n\n    Matching keys unlock\n    Opposites tighten the door\n  \
  \  Truth lies in sameness\n    \nThe encrypted note is attached. Can you decode\
  \ it and find what message the killer left behind?"
