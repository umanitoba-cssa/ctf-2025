description: "The Haiku Hunter's third victim has been discovered - a librarian found\
  \ dead amidst scattered puzzle pieces. Once again, a haiku was left at the scene:\n\
  \n    Scattered pieces wait\n    Each fragment yearns for its place\n    Order hides\
  \ in words\n    \nAlong with the haiku, a strange encoded message was found. Stranger\
  \ still, a lengthy letter was discovered nearby that seems to contain the Haiku\
  \ Hunter's manifesto. The detectives believe the key to decoding the message lies\
  \ somewhere within this text."
