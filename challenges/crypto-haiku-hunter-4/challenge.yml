description: "The Haiku Hunter's reign of terror is nearing its climax! A senior cryptographer\
  \ was found dead in a locked room with only a computer displaying an encrypted file\
  \ and a final haiku:\n\n    Advanced standard hides\n    Words wear masks of other\
  \ words\n    Last bytes must be found\n\nThe computer contains an encrypted file\
  \ and a peculiar document titled \"cipher.txt\" that appears to be a translation\
  \ dictionary of some kind - each line contains a common English word. There's also\
  \ a sticky note with \"1337\" written on it, followed by \"Partial key only! Last\
  \ 16-bits missing.\"\n\nForensics revealed that the victim was working on advanced\
  \ cryptographic algorithms. Their recent browser history shows research on AES encryption,\
  \ SHA-256 hashing algorithms, and classical substitution techniques. A notepad was\
  \ found with scribbled notes: \"CBC mode... use words as byte values... hash the\
  \ seed...\"\n\nThis could be our last chance to stop the Haiku Hunter before their\
  \ \"masterpiece\" is complete. Decrypt the message and end this nightmare once and\
  \ for all."
