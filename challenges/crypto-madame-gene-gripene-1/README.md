## Description

Salutations, my dearest hacker interns.

My dear husband, Jean Kripene, was one of the lead detectives in this mystery. Unfortunately, he was hostpitalized after tripping over a chair and hitting his cranium. His notes are still on his computer, but they've been locked away.

I need you to prove your ability in decrypting and deciphering these messages. Therefore, you will need to pass this first, single test. *She passes you a note with a scrambled flag and the symbol XLII*.

## Solution
This is going to be a basic Caesar Cipher. Easy points. Shifted 42 (16) times. Hint is 42 in Roman Numerals.

## Flag
