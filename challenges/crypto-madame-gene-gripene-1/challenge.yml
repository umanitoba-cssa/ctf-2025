description: 'Salutations, my dearest hacker interns.


  My dear husband, Jean Kripene, was one of the lead detectives in this mystery. Unfortunately,
  he was hostpitalized after tripping over a chair and hitting his cranium. His notes
  are still on his computer, but they''ve been locked away.


  I need you to prove your ability in decrypting and deciphering these messages. Therefore,
  you will need to pass this first, single test. *She passes you a note with a scrambled
  flag and the symbol XLII*.'
