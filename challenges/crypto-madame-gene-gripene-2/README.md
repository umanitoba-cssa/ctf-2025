## Description

Good job - let's get to it then.

My late husband's server is here.  He left this note for me, but I haven't been able to get into his server at all. All I know is the person on that note he refers to, he's talked about before, but none of us could find this Eren Egiv. 

Once you're able to login, I'm sure you can use it as a flag for your project. This internship of yours needs some phrase, yes? I'm sure my husband thought of this beforehand. 


## Hint 1

Eren Egiv's name looks a little funny backwards, doesn't it? 


## Hint 2

My husband mentioned visiting Eren Egiv's fort once. He called it "un tres beau fort."

## Solution

This is a reverse Vigenere cipher, otherwise known as a Beauford cipher. The key is "erenegiv", which is just vigenere backwards. It's a double hint :D
The key resolves it to CSSA{IMINMOOTOWN}
