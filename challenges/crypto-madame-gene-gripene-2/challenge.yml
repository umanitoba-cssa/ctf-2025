  My late husband''s server is here. He left this note for me, but I haven''t been able to get into his server at all. All I know is the person on that note he refers to, he''s talked about before, but none of us could find this Eren Egiv. *That name rolls on the tongue.*


  Once you''re able to login, I''m sure you can use it as a flag for your project. This internship of yours needs some phrase, yes? I''m sure my husband thought of this beforehand.


  (Note: The solution must be prefixed with `cssa{` and postfixed with `}` to be a valid flag.)'
