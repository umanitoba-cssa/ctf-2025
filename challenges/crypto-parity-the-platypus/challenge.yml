description: 'Dear Detective,


  I finished creating a program that should help remove some tedious work in detective work and the program has been encrypted and sent as binary. Unfortunately, I learned that an evil-doer has blasted it with their least-significant-bit-flip-inator and the program won''t decrypt anymore.


  Luckily, I have a failsafe mechinism implemented where the 8th bit from the left (1st bit from the right) must be 1 if the number of 1s is odd and 0 if the number of 1s is even. Perhaps if we figure out which 8-bit words were affected (and no longer pass the failsafe), we can actually gain information about this evil-doer! I have split up the program into lines of 8-bits for ease of digestion.


  I await your reply,

  P.P.'
