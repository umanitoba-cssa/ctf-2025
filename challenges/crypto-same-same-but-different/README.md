## Description:
'Ey boss, we found a few of things written in blood at the scene of the crime... roughly around where the victim's body was found. Must be a dyin' message eh? Anyways, it was pretty hard to figure out what they meant by the things written so we just transcribed 'em in this 'ere paper. Best of luck to ya, detective.

## Solution
This is a hex string duplicated three times with some minor changes. You should notice that some of the text is not valid hex (such as 7T) but it only exists in one duplication but not the other two.

So simply split the string into 3 sections, iterate through them and copy over the most common character between the three. Then run through a hex to text converter and reveal the flag.

`63 73 73 61 63 74 66 7B 54 72 69 70 6C 65 5F 54 68 72 65 61 74 5F 49 73 5F 42 65 73 74 5F 54 68 72 65 61 74 7D`

## Flag 
`cssactf{Triple_Threat_Is_Best_Threat}`
