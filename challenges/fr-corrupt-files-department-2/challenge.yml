description: 'Welcome to the Corrupt Files Department, you think in your head. Earlier
  today, your junior detective handed you a piece of evidence that they had clumsily
  opened and saved in **Windows** with some jank **text editor** program to save as
  a **PDF** file, messing it up even when you use a **Linux** system like a righteous
  detective would. Perhaps it''s still saveable after some tinkering, so you unfurl
  your eyebrows and get to work.


  Hints:

  1. What do *nix systems and Windows systems do differently specifically with text
  editing?'
