# John's Digital Gallery 1
- Revision 0
- Forensics

## Description
Detective! We've received an anonymous tip about the existence of a suspicious establishment called John's Digital Gallery. After investigating, we've recovered several suspicious pictures that seemed to have been tampered with, but we couldn't find any further evidence. Perhaps you could lend us your insight?

The owner claims that these two pictures are actually one disconnected piece of modern art, but, to be honest, I'm not a connoisseur of such abstract pieces and I think there's more to it than he says.

## Solution
XOR the two images using an image editor such as Paint.NET by opening the two images as separate layers and selecting the XOR blend mode.

## Flag
`cssactf{7r4n517}`
