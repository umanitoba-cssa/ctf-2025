description: 'Detective! We''ve received an anonymous tip about the existence of a suspicious establishment called John''s Digital Gallery. After investigating, we''ve recovered several suspicious pictures that seemed to have been tampered with, but we couldn''t find any further evidence. Perhaps you could lend us your insight?


  The owner claims that these two pictures are actually one disconnected piece of modern art, but, to be honest, I''m not a connoisseur of such abstract pieces and I think there''s more to it than he says. Anyways, I''m gonna grab a blended coffee frappé. Get this done before I get back.'
