description: "Detective! We've received an anonymous tip about the existence of a\
  \ suspicious establishment called John's Digital Gallery. After investigating, we've\
  \ recovered several suspicious pictures that seemed to have been tampered with,\
  \ but we couldn't find any further evidence. Perhaps you could lend us your insight?\n\
  \nThe owner claims that these two pictures are actually one disconnected piece of\
  \ modern art, but, to be honest, I'm not a connoisseur of such abstract pieces and\
  \ I think there's more to it than he says. Anyways, I'm gonna grab a blended coffee\
  \ frapp\xE9. Get this done before I get back."
