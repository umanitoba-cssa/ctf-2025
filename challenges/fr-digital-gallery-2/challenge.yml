description: 'Detective! We''ve received an anonymous tip about the existence of a
  suspicious establishment called John''s Digital Gallery. After investigating, we''ve
  recovered several suspicious pictures that seemed to have been tampered with, but
  we couldn''t find any further evidence. Perhaps you could lend us your insight?


  This picture looks normal, but the owner said that there''s *more than meets the
  eye* and that *little things can carry a lot of meaning* when we asked him about
  the picture. Quite suspicious, no? We have little to work with this time, so squeeze
  out as much as you can from this by the end of the day.'
