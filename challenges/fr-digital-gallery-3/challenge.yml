description: 'Detective! We''ve received an anonymous tip about the existence of a
  suspicious establishment called John''s Digital Gallery. After investigating, we''ve
  recovered several suspicious pictures that seemed to have been tampered with, but
  we couldn''t find any further evidence. Perhaps you could lend us your insight?


  John, the owner, described this picture as *quite moving* and *gets better with
  time*. It just looks like a random picture of a street to me and I don''t have time
  to be staring at this thing. Maybe you can look into the future or something haha
  and see what he means. Take care of this.'
