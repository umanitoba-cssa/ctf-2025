description: "Idea provided by Rob Guderian (thanks Rob).\n\nThe notorious \"Knock-Knock Killer\" has been terrorizing the city of Ravenholm for months, leaving a trail of precisely arranged crime scenes and cryptic messages. Detective Sarah Miller has been tracking this methodical serial killer across three brutal murders, growing increasingly desperate as the pattern suggests a fourth victim is imminent.\n\nEach victim was found in a carefully staged tableau, with peculiar marks on door frames suggesting the killer announces their presence with a specific sequence of knocks before entering. Neighbors have reported hearing four knocks at a time, but they aren't sure what happened next.\n\nAfter investigating the third murder scene yesterday, Detective Miller discovered a weathered leather-bound journal hidden beneath a floorboard. The journal appears to belong to the killer and contains this chilling entry written in meticulous handwriting:\n\n> *\"My work begins when the clock strikes\
  \ twelve and darkness reigns supreme. The first announcement of my presence shall come at port 3712, when the stars align and the moon casts no shadow.*\n> \n> *Each knock brings me closer to my masterpiece. The sequence must be perfect, or the ritual fails.*\n> \n> *Tonight, I will complete what I started. The next victim has been chosen. Their door awaits my touch.\"*\n\nThe journal entry abruptly ends there. Detective Miller believes that by following the killer's knock pattern, she might intercept crucial information about the next victim's location or identity. The department's cyber forensics unit has detected unusual network traffic from what they believe is the killer's command server.\n\nThe clock is ticking. Can you help Detective Miller decode the knock sequence and potentially save a life before midnight strikes again? Navigate to the killer's server running at `<server_ip>`, if you can find your way..."
