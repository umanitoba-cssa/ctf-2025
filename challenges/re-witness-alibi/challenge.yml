description: 'We got access to the alibi of one of our witnesses. We''ve taken a look
  and checked everything, but it doesn''t seem to hold up. She swears she''s innocent
  but we can''t seem to find anything here to support that claim.

  The worst part of it all? She''s gone missing now and we can''t get a hold of her.


  She said something about booby trapping this file... muttered something about a
  killer being after her. She seemed paranoid.


  Anyway, can you help us take a look at her alibi and make sure it checks out?


  Hints:

  1. The binary is compiled with debug symbols.

  2. She seemed to say something about setting up a decoy alibi. Can you check if
  her real alibi is around somewhere?'
