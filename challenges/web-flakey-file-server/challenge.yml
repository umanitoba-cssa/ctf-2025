description: 'We''ve linked a certain internet user to a recent crime, but we have no idea who is behind the pseudonym. They have been pretty good at covering their tracks and hiding their identity. The only thing we''ve found is their personal file server. Could you poke around the server and see if there''s anything that might tell us who this person is?

  Hints:

  1. The web server has a certain directory set as the ''base'' directory, is there any way we could navigate to directories outside that one?

  2. Your browser might prevent you from typing certain characters in a URL, is there another way you can write them?'
