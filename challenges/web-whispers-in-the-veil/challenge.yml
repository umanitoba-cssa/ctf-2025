description: 'The murder investigation of tech mogul Daniel Crowe has hit a dead end. While the prime suspect, known online as nexxode, was seen near the scene of the crime, investigators believe they had accomplices—co-conspirators hiding in the digital shadows.


  All clues point to VeilChat, a secretive chat platform known for its underground user base. Authorities have identified nexxode as an active user, but without access to their chat history, the case remains unsolved.


  Your mission: Hack into VeilChat and uncover the conversations of those in contact with nexxode.
