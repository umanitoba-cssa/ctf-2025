description: "The murder investigation of tech mogul Daniel Crowe has hit a dead end.\
  \ While the prime suspect, known online as nexxode, was seen near the scene of the\
  \ crime, investigators believe they had accomplices\u2014co-conspirators hiding\
  \ in the digital shadows.\n\nAll clues point to VeilChat, a secretive chat platform\
  \ known for its underground user base. Authorities have identified nexxode as an\
  \ active user, but without access to their chat history, the case remains unsolved.\n\
  \nYour mission: Hack into VeilChat and uncover the conversations of those in contact\
  \ with nexxode.\n\n<http://whispers-in-the-veil.ctf.umanitobacssa.ca:30402>\n\n\
  Hints:\n- Have the developers left any useful clues behind in the source code of\
  \ any of the pages?\n- Is there anything interesting about how the home page works?"
