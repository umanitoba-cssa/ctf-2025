Detective! We've received an anonymous tip about the existence of a suspicious establishment called John's Digital Gallery. After investigating, we've recovered several suspicious pictures that seemed to have been tampered with, but we couldn't find any further evidence. Perhaps you could lend us your insight?

This picture looks normal, but the owner said that there's "more than meets the eye" when we asked him about the picture. Quite suspicious, no?
